I am Mahdi Hasan, P.hD. candidate in the department of Marine Earth and Atmospheric Science (MEAS) at North Carolina State University.  My research interests include large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations, climate variability and change. I am currently advised by Dr. Sarah Larson, assistant professor of the MEAS department at NC State. Prior to joining NC State, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics.
