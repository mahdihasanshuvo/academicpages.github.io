Projected expansion of Hadley circulation is linked to changes in the ocean variability
======
Atmospheric surface wind drives upper ocean circulations. Hence, a change in the near-surface atmospheric wind pattern causes a change in ocean circulation. There is evidence that climate change alters the spatial pattern and strength of the surface winds. In particular, easterly (east to west) prevailing winds in the subtropical regions are projected to expand poleward in accordance with the poleward expansion of the tropical atmospheric circulation, also known as the Hadley circulation. The poleward shift of the subtropical easterly wind belt also has potential implications for the subtropical sea surface temperature (SST) variations because two important drivers of the SST are related to the surface wind. The first one is the turbulent air-sea heat exchange, which is a combination of latent and sensible heat fluxes and is dependent upon available atmospheric moisture and near-surface wind speed. The second one is the advection of ocean temperatures by anomalous wind-driven ocean currents (also known as Ekman heat flux), which is related to the surface wind stress. In the subtropical regions (roughly in between 10-to-30-degree latitudes), these two fluxes typically oppose each other, acting to reduce the amplitude of SST variations. Meanwhile, in the midlatitudes (poleward of subtropics), the fluxes tend to reinforce each other to enhance SST variability. Since both observations and climate model simulations suggest that the human-induced forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas forcing) due to climate change has already expanded and will expand the subtropical easterly prevailing wind poleward in the future, we hypothesize that the change of the prevailing surface wind can potentially impact subtropical SST variability by modulating the relationship between Ekman and turbulent heat fluxes. Using a series of climate model simulations, we find that the subtropical regions where the anomalous turbulent and Ekman heat fluxes oppose each other are projected to expand towards the poles. This result is consistent with the projected poleward shift in the subtropical easterlies due to the Hadley expansion, which has potential implications for the change in subtropical SST variability.![image](https://github.com/mahdihasanshuvo/mahdihasanshuvo.github.io/assets/42149009/531d8fec-98bc-4924-81d9-997c5030e861)
